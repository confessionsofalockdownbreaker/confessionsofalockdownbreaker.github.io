							<p>Far, far away, beyond the rising peaks of coronavirus in Europe, there exists a country that knows nothing of a “tiered approach” or a “mass-testing strategy”, and even struggles to comprehend what “social distancing” could entail...</p>

							<p>This is the land known as Bulgaria. When we found out about this fairytale land we packed my seven single-use masks, put on our PPE on and we were on our way.  When we reached Sofia, nestled in the foothills of Mt Vitosha on a crisp Sunday evening, we were ready to explore the agar-plateau of Bulgaria. Little did we know it would be at a point when Bulgaria’s infection rate would soon outpace the rest of the continent. Having just inserted ourselves into Bulgarian society from the UK, like the viral component infecting the host cell, we were eager and ready to spread to all cellular inhabitants of Sofia. </p>

							<p>Bulgaria was not governed by the universal law termed the Coronavirus “R number”, there was no such number, or letter, as R. Instead, the land was governed by a set of ill-trained political practitioners, who infected the country with their destabilising politics. There was no antidote to the drug-like concoction of laws, which are composed of key compounds like corruption, bribes, and misinformation. These laws were supposed to provide an Anti-inflammatory environment for the general populace, while keeping the dominant genes in power and their hosts’ self interests fulfilled. However, these rules led to reactionary side effects such as political dissent, commonly demonstrated through a lack of mask-wearing. However, in extreme cases, long-term effects of this are protesting for 145 days. </p>

							<p>We arrived in Bulgaria on the 145th day of protest. Our transmission journey started in Sofia, the modern capital of Bulgaria. During our time in Sofia, we replicated my genetic code though sharing laughter, alcohol, advice, and experiences with locals, and friends. We enjoyed the host-cell like city of Sofia, exploring its beautifully architected Orthodox Christian churches. By the time we had visited the ancient city of Plovdiv, then made our way back to Sofia for a final week of celebrations, the recently adapted and emergent novel disease agent and several stricter restrictions were imposed. </p>

							<p>Some of these new laws led to incidents which persecuted those who were vulnerable. For example, we came across in the morning news an acute response to the novel coronavirus pandemic from a local store owner. In this instance, an elderly person wanted to buy bread at 10.30am, a mere half an hour after the “green corridor” timeframe from 8:00am to 10:00am where vulnerable members of the community can shop for essential goods. The local store owner spotted an old-aged pensioner perusing tinned tuna on aisle four, and immediately set the security personnel on him to demand his identity cards as proof of age. The situation was elevated higher than the top supermarket shelf when the police arrived and threatened to arrest the elderly person. </p>

							<p>After we safely negotiated our entrance into supermarkets outside of the “green corridor” time of shopping, we explored Sofia’s culinary delights of the supermarkets, in particular taking time to explore the Womans Market in a socially distant manner. Here, we discovered the larger-than-life Bulgarian groceries, such as spring onions over 4ft! Our supermarket endeavors culminated in a small obsession with thracian wine (Thrace being a geographical and historical region in Southeast Europe), which manifested in the regular purchasing of a popular bulgarian wine “four friends”. “Four friends” certainly gained two more friends, or alternatively, our regular purchase of two bottles a night made the “four friends” name seem very apt. Us, the two bottles of four friends, along with a foray of oversized vegetables, become loved and trusted member of “bubble” as we “sheltered in place”.</p>

							<p>However, the effect of the pathogenic virus familiar to many as Covid-19 did not lay dormant within the cellular community of Bulgaria for long. In order to quell the severest of symptoms, the Government imposed a 3-week lockdown from the 27th November. At the time the announcement was being made, we were investigating a new method of vector tramission which we could use to migrate to our host country, the so-called safe haven of coronavirus Germany ...</p>
