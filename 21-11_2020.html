							<p>I’m not sure what time it is when the phone goes off. I peer at it from under the covers, narrowing my eyes against the phone’s flashing message and the pain of waking up after six glasses of wine, recognising the long curls and striped jacket of a girl I’d been on a date with the night before in the Whatsapp photo.</p>

							<p>“Hey not sure if you read the news,” the message reads. “We’ll be going into another lockdown starting Friday. </p>

							<p>Over the past week, we had decided to conduct an experiment. On-the-ground research covering several Tinder dates, all asked whether Bulgaria was going to lockdown and whether we were wise to stay. From it we quickly learned that the government had made it compulsory to wear masks in all outdoor spaces. This surprised us, for one, because we saw almost no-one wearing a mask outside, and because no one had told us off for not wearing one. </p>

							<p>This gave us an idea. The responses we kept getting were that the Bulgarian government was too afraid of locking down, finding itself on its 140th day of consecutive corruption protest as we arrived, and therefore was unlikely to put all its energy into keeping people inside for fear of igniting more protests. It brought us to the conclusion that the countries we ought to be targeting should be semi-despotic countries; authoritarian enough to ignore the rest of the world’s preoccupation with lockdown restrictions, but weak enough so that a substantial display of police power would result in nation-wide backlash and possible political overthrow. With Bulgaria, we had hit the sweet spot. At least, so we thought until that message came through. </p>

							<p>I sit up in bed, hangover forgotten. This is it. The moment we’ve prepared for. Time to get out of Bulgaria. </p>
							<p>We’d been there nearly a month already, and the warning signs had been there for weeks now. The early shop closures, the last minute party cancellations because someone felt sick, the rising tide of bobbing face-masks in Sofia centre growing ever bluer.</p>
							<p>But we were ready. We’d done it before. This would be the fifth country we’d fled since the pandemic, and we were pros at it by now. Case and point, we already had a Ryanair flight booked for Friday. Right in time to escape before the gates closed on the rest of Bulgaria.</p>

							<p>Done it again! I thought, flinging the covers back and running to share the news. My proud announcement is stymied by a forlorn response from my co-traveller. We bicker for a good ten minutes before jumping on our phones and scraping the web for any details.</p>
							<p>One line stands out:</p>

							<div class="row rp-b">
								<div class="col-md-12 animate-box">
									<blockquote>
										<p>&ldquo;The restrictions, which will start late on Friday, are aimed at preventing a strained health system from being overwhelmed and at halting the spread of infections in the Balkan country of seven million people. &rdquo; <cite>&mdash;  Tsvetelia Tsolova, Reuters, 25th November 2020</cite></p>

								<blockquote>
									<p>&ldquo;...late on Friday…&rdquo;</p>

						<p>We check the time of our Ryanair flight. 17:00 departure, Friday. Fuck. </p>

						<p>It would mean cutting it close, sure. But five o’clock wasn’t that late, right? And surely they aren’t going to ground the flights? That would be silly. </p>
						<p>Zooming through the rest of the article, we land on another line:</p>
						<div class="row rp-b">
							<div class="col-md-12 animate-box">
								<blockquote>
									<p>&ldquo;Tourist trips at home and abroad will be banned.&rdquo;</p>

							<p>We argue for about another half hour or so. On the side arguing in favour of risking the unspecific Friday lockdown is yours truly. We already had a flight to Berlin. When we got to Sofia, they hadn’t so much as needed a signature saying “no I promise I don’t have coronavirus” to get through the gate. Would the Bulgarian government’s lacklustre response switch to canceling all flights within hours of the restrictions coming in? I had my doubts. That’s assuming it even applied to flights on Friday, after all.</p>
							<p>On the other side, arguing we should change out flight and leave earlier, was Krishna. We’d already signed a three-month contract in Berlin, and already forked over a not-insignificant £1,268 for it, too.</p>

							<p>If we got stuck in Bulgaria, we got stuck for a long time. No apartment, no Berlin, no managing to sneak into Europe and gain Germany residency ahead of Brexit. The entire plan was kaput.</p>
							<p>It didn’t take long to convince me. About twenty minutes later I was opening three different Q&A incognito tabs to find out the least expensive way of changing a Ryanair flight.</p>
							<p>Krishna had already changed hers by the time it took me to get into my account. No flights on Thursday - fuck - and it would cost extra to fly earlier - fuck, fuck, fuck - and it’s taking me forever to find the flight.</p>

							<figure class="animate-box">
								<img src="images/15-11-2020/TOT02573.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-responsive">
							</figure>
							<p>Finally, I get into it. There’s my flight, Friday afternoon. I click on the “amend flights” button.</p>
							<p>Nothing. I close down all other tabs and windows and click on it. Nothing. I restart my browser, then my laptop, then logging in with a different device, and then using different browsers. The “amend flight” button continues to load indefinitely, even though Krishna got through and managed to amend it almost immediately.</p>
							<p>So, I’m not saying that Ryanair employs people to read the news and then deliberately stop people from amending their flights so they can charge them extra, but I’m not saying they totally wouldn’t do that either.</p>
							<p>Maybe it was because a lot of other people had heard the news, or, more likely, it was an international airline conspiracy which flies into motion the instant a lockdown is announced.</p>
							<p>Anyway, the result was an extra £50 for a flight on Wednesday. We contact our Berlin AirBNB and say we’re landing early.</p>

							<p>“When exactly is your flight?” he asks us. Well, em, it’s complicated. We play dumb and act like we totally weren’t all that sure. Krishna chats with him and he’s all cool with us arriving early. Awesome. Oh, but there’s a girl living there who might be around and doesn’t want you there unless you get a test and wear masks at all times indoors. Not so awesome, but we’ve booked it now, so, hey ho.</p>
							<p>On Wednesday, the day arrived. Neither of us have booked a day off work, because… well, we wanted to get away with not taking a day off work and also escaping the soon-to-be-locked-down politically unstable Republic of Bulgaria at the same time. We’re flying at five, wanting to get to the airport for around 3pm.</p>
							<p>It’s 3:15pm and I’m asking Krishna why she isn’t getting mad at me for not-having packed already. She has a go at me for rushing her.</p>
							<p>“It’s only a twelve minute journey!” she snaps, typing away on the keyboard.</p>
							<figure class="animate-box">
								<img src="images/21-11-2020/TOT02585.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-responsive">
							</figure>
							<p>We scrabble to get ready, call a taxi, and are at the airport a good half hour later. We try to go through some kind of temporary Covid-19 barrier where they ask us where we’re going. We say “Berlin”, wondering if there’s someone behind a desk scanning through a list of blacklisted cities whose ears have just pricked up.</p>
							<p>If such a list existed, Berlin didn’t seem to be on it. We go on through. Barely a soul there. Perfect.</p>
							<p>“Do you have your German entry form?” I hear Krishna getting asked ahead of me. We look at each other. German entry form? You what now?</p>
							<p>It was done, we were busted, I thought, pretending to look in my carry-on bag for a form I knew I didn’t have. They’d found us out. We were about to be sent to airport prison where we’d sit for a few hours being talked to in Bulgarian, before the real feds would walk in and show photos of us traveling all over Europe. We’ve been looking for you two for a long time, they’d say, before slapping the cuffs on us, charging us as Covid-spreaders, and taking us away for the rest of our days.</p>
							<p>The entry-form man sighs. “Take this,” he says, handing us both a form, and letting us through.</p>
							<p>As it turns out, we had done it. We’d escaped, yet again. Lived to taste freedom another day; albeit locked-down in Germany, along with everyone else.</p>
							<p>Oh, and by the following weekend it was clear we totally could have gotten the Friday flight. But ah well. I try not to reflect on such things.</p>
							<p>Berlin was ahead, as was the scramble to find accommodation. By then, we were already having to deal with getting scammed out of our Berlin accommodation, and our minds were on other things.</p>
