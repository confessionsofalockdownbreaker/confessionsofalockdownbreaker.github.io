							<p>One day when we were waiting for our laundry to be finished, we passed by a restaurant we weren’t sure was open. It had a painted cave ceiling and a polished wooden bar.</p>
							<p>We had around half an hour to spare so we asked a staff member if we could grab a beer. It turned out he was the owner, and quickly obliged.</p>

							<p>“Hold on,” I said, awkwardly fumbling through my wallet to try and teethe out ten-cent pieces among Bulgarian coins.</p>
							<p>But he was more interested in talking, waving my coins away and telling me it didn’t matter if I had the full amount or not. I ended up handing over around 20 cents short of the total.</p>
							<p>The owner was from Bangladesh, living in German for over a decade with a wife and kids. With the business shut for nearly a year, he was over €40K in debt.</p>
							<p>He hadn’t gotten any help from the government, he said, because he had only opened the business in February and had no tax history. He’d worked in a Mexican restaurant for seven years and finally saved up enough money to buy his own.</p>
							<div class="col-lg-4 animate-box">
								<div class="fh5co-highlight right">
									<h4>Highlight</h4>
									<p>With the business shut for nearly a year, he was over €40K in debt. </p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>Before Covid hit, he would be able to make anywhere from €3K-€4K at the weekend, with maybe another €2K during the weekdays. Now, he was lucky to clear €200 for the entire week.</p>
							<p>After talking for a while longer he confessed to the levels of debt he owed and how he hadn’t been able to defer payments. He had been advised to sell the property, but doubted he would be able to find any buyers.</p>
							<p>He was in tears as he spoke. “It’s Christmas in Berlin,” he said, shaking. “And just look outside.”</p>

						<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 cp-l animate-box">
							<p>There was no one there. We were clearly the only customers he had seen all day. And we hadn’t even been able to pay for the full price of the beers.</p>

							<p>We walked back to the laundromat in silence. It put our own recent troubles into perspective. </p>
							<p>Christmas is cancelled, read the pronouncements on Twitter and other blinking news notifications scattered across the internet. </p>
							<p>It wasn’t just semi-cancelled, in the sense that gran wouldn’t be there and we might have to eat at opposite ends of the table, it was fully cancelled. No going home.</p>
							<p>The UK was shutdown, even more so than Germany. The two of us had both had flights booked for the next few days, but a mutant strain of Covid-19 had put an end to those plans.</p>
							<p>Both of us knew we would miss our flights to the UK, calling our families to let them know we’d be spending Christmas in a Berlin studio.</p>
